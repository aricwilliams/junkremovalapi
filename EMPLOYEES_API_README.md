## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=junkremoval

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Database Configuration
```javascript
// config/database.js
module.exports = {
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  user: process.env.DB_USER || 'root',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'password',
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'junkremoval',
  waitForConnections: true,
  connectionLimit: 10,
  queueLimit: 0
};
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient JOIN operations
- Pagination for large datasets
- Connection pooling

### API Optimization
- Response caching for static data
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Efficient validation schemas
- Optimized SQL queries

## üîÑ Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- **Default**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authenticated users**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes
- **Admin users**: 5000 requests per 15 minutes

## üìù Logging

### Log Levels
- `ERROR` - Application errors and exceptions
- `WARN` - Warning conditions
- `INFO` - General information
- `DEBUG` - Detailed debugging information

### Log Format
```json

  "message": "Employee created successfully",
  "employee_id": "emp-123",
  "user_id": "user-456",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100"
}
```
